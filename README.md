# Automated Google Search Script

This script automates Google searches using the `pyautogui` library. It performs searches on both a PC-like interface and a mobile-like interface using randomly generated search terms.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- `pyautogui` and `random_word` libraries installed. Install them using:

    ```
    pip install pyautogui
    ```
    ```
    pip install random_word
    ```

- Google Chrome browser installed at the specified path.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the script (`automated_search.py`) directly.

2. Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Run the script using the following command:

    ```
    python automated_search.py
    ```

4. The script will perform automated Google searches on both a PC-like and a mobile-like interface.

## Customization

- You can customize the number of searches performed by changing the `number_of_searches` variable in the `pc()` and `mb()` functions.

- Make sure to adjust the `bro` variable with the correct path to your Chrome browser executable.
